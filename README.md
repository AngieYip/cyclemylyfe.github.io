# INTRODUCTION
“CycleMyLyfe” is a VR-based application, which cyclists and Personal Mobility Device (PMD) users can use to practice safe riding in Singapore. “CycleMyLyfe” also allows a secondary goal for non-cyclists to empathize with cyclists on the road. This software will be designed to be as close as possible to the streets and park connectors in the Real Environment (RE).
The purpose of this software design specification document is to design and provide a detailed description of the architecture design with the help of pointers to give overall guidance to the “CycleMyLyfe” application.
The description is required to coordinate the Safe Cycling Task Force (SCTF)’s aim to improve cycling safety in Singapore. It needs to be a stable reference and outline all parts of the software and how it works.

# HOW TO RUN

# For Players:
Upon successfully login into the player page, the player will have three options to choose for, which is the Rules & Regulations, Select Level and Play Game.


When the player click the Rules & Regulations button, he is able to see the ground rules he is required to follow for the application.


The player can choose a game level up to his preference via a drop-down button. 


And lastly, after the player has selected his ideal game level, he is able to play the application.

# For SCTF Members:
Upon successfully login into the SCTF page, the SCTF member is able to view the SCTF page.


As the SCTF member, he is able to amend the number of vehicles and pedestrians which the amendments will take place in the game itself. Also, should the he wants to have a more relistic game experience for the players, he can upload a 360 degree video into the application.


After he has finalised the amendments, he will save the changes and the game will be amended based on the changes of the environment, number of vehicles and pedestrians that were set by the SCTF member.
