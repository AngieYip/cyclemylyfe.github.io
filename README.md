# INTRODUCTION
“CycleMyLyfe” is a VR-based application, which cyclists and Personal Mobility Device (PMD) users can use to practice safe riding in Singapore. “CycleMyLyfe” also allows a secondary goal for non-cyclists to empathize with cyclists on the road. This software will be designed to be as close as possible to the streets and park connectors in the Real Environment (RE).
The purpose of this software design specification document is to design and provide a detailed description of the architecture design with the help of pointers to give overall guidance to the “CycleMyLyfe” application.
The description is required to coordinate the Safe Cycling Task Force (SCTF)’s aim to improve cycling safety in Singapore. It needs to be a stable reference and outline all parts of the software and how it works.
